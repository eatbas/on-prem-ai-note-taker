## 🔍 Current Frontend Architecture Analysis

### ✅ **Strong Foundation (Well-Architected)**
- **React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.5.4**: Modern, type-safe development
- **Vite 5.4.1**: Fast build tool with HMR
- **Electron 30.0.9**: Cross-platform desktop wrapper
- **Dexie 4.0.8**: Efficient IndexedDB management
- **Dual Audio Recording**: Separate microphone and system audio streams
- **Background Processing**: Persistent job management across navigation
- **Local-First Architecture**: Offline-capable with VPS sync

### ❌ **Performance Bottlenecks Identified**

#### 🎵 **Audio Processing Bottlenecks**
- **1-second chunking**: Creates 3600 chunks for 1-hour meeting (excessive overhead)
- **Single large upload**: Assembles entire file in memory before upload
- **No compression**: Raw WebM files without optimization
- **Memory intensive**: All chunks loaded into memory during assembly
- **No streaming upload**: Blocks UI during large file uploads

#### 🎨 **UI Performance Issues**
- **No React optimization**: Missing `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`
- **Excessive re-renders**: Audio level updates trigger unnecessary component updates
- **No code splitting**: Large bundle size affects initial load time
- **No lazy loading**: All components loaded upfront
- **Inefficient state management**: Props drilling without context optimization

#### 📦 **Bundle & Loading Optimizations**
- **No tree shaking optimization**: Unused code included in bundle
- **No manual chunks**: Vendor and app code mixed in single bundle
- **No prefetching**: Critical resources not preloaded
- **No service worker**: Missing offline and caching capabilities

#### 💾 **Data Management Inefficiencies**
- **localStorage overuse**: Large job data stored in localStorage
- **No data compression**: Text data stored without compression
- **Inefficient IndexedDB usage**: Missing compound indexes and query optimization
- **No background sync**: Manual refresh required for data updates
