# Audio Recording Issue Analysis & Diagnosis

## Problem Summary
The audio recording functionality that was working 2 days ago is now broken. Users cannot store audio files during meetings.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Recent Code Changes**
The codebase has undergone significant changes in the audio recording system:

- **Dual MediaRecorder Implementation**: Added separate recorders for microphone and system audio
- **Database Schema Changes**: Added `audioType` field to `Chunk` type
- **Complex Audio Mixing**: Implemented Whisper-optimized audio processing with AudioContext
- **Multiple Fallback Methods**: Added progressive fallback for system audio capture

### 2. **Potential Breaking Points**

#### **A. Database Schema Mismatch**
```typescript
// NEW: audioType field was added
export type Chunk = {
    id: string
    meetingId: string
    index: number
    blob: Blob
    createdAt: number
    audioType: AudioType  // ‚Üê This is new and required
}
```

#### **B. Complex Audio Device Selection**
```typescript
// The microphone selection logic might be failing
const micToUse = selectedMic || (availableMics.length > 0 ? availableMics[0].deviceId : undefined)
micStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: {
        deviceId: micToUse && micToUse !== 'default' ? { exact: micToUse } : undefined
    }
})
```

#### **C. System Audio Capture Complexity**
The system now tries multiple methods in sequence:
1. Modern `getDisplayMedia` method
2. DesktopCapturer fallback  
3. Legacy `chromeMediaSource` method

If any of these fail, it might break the entire recording process.

#### **D. Audio Context and Mixing Issues**
```typescript
const ctx = new AudioContext({ 
    sampleRate: 16000 // Whisper's optimal sample rate
})
```
The complex audio mixing setup might be causing issues on some systems.

## Diagnosis Steps

### 1. **Use the Audio Recording Tester**
I've added a new "üîß Audio Test" tab to the Dashboard that will help diagnose the issue:

- **Audio Device Detection**: Shows all available microphones
- **Recording Test**: Tests basic MediaRecorder functionality
- **Database Test**: Verifies IndexedDB is working
- **Real-time Logs**: Shows exactly what's happening during recording

### 2. **Check Browser Console**
Look for JavaScript errors in the Electron console:
- MediaRecorder errors
- AudioContext errors
- Database errors
- Permission errors

### 3. **Verify Audio Permissions**
- Check if microphone permissions are still granted
- Verify the correct microphone is selected
- Test if system audio capture permissions are working

### 4. **Test Database Functionality**
The tester includes a database test that will verify:
- IndexedDB is accessible
- Chunks can be written and read
- The new `audioType` field is working

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. **Reset Audio Permissions**
- Close the Electron app completely
- Reopen and grant microphone permissions again
- Check if system audio permissions are requested

### 2. **Verify Audio Device Selection**
- Use the Audio Test tab to see all available devices
- Ensure the correct microphone is selected
- Test recording with different devices

### 3. **Check System Audio Settings**
- **Windows**: Enable "Stereo Mix" in Sound settings
- **macOS**: Check System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
- **Linux**: Verify PulseAudio configuration

### 4. **Database Reset (Last Resort)**
If the database schema is corrupted:
```javascript
// In the Audio Test tab, use the "Test Database" button
// If it fails, you may need to clear the database
```

## Expected Behavior vs Current Behavior

### **Before (Working)**
- Simple MediaRecorder setup
- Basic audio mixing
- Direct blob saving to IndexedDB
- Single audio stream recording

### **After (Broken)**
- Dual MediaRecorder setup
- Complex AudioContext mixing
- Whisper-optimized processing
- Multiple fallback methods
- Enhanced error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Use the Audio Test tab** to diagnose the specific issue
2. **Check the console logs** for error messages
3. **Test with the simple recording** to isolate the problem
4. **Verify database functionality** is working
5. **Check audio device selection** and permissions

## Files Modified for Diagnosis

- `frontend/src/components/recording/AudioRecordingTester.tsx` - New diagnostic component
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added Audio Test tab
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added route for audio testing

## How to Use the Audio Tester

1. Open the app and go to the Dashboard
2. Click the "üîß Audio Test" tab
3. Click "üîÑ Refresh Devices" to see available microphones
4. Select your microphone from the dropdown
5. Click "üéôÔ∏è Start Recording" to test basic recording
6. Click "üóÑÔ∏è Test Database" to verify storage
7. Check the debug logs for any errors

This will help identify exactly where the recording process is failing.
