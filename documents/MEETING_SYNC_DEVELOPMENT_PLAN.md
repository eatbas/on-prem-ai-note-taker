# Meeting Sync & VPS Integration Development Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for implementing seamless meeting synchronization between local storage and VPS, preventing duplicate uploads, and optimizing the VPS performance issues.

## üìã Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working (**UPDATED - Dec 2024**)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Status System**: 5-stage status tracking (local ‚Üí queued ‚Üí uploading ‚Üí processing ‚Üí synced)
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart duplicate checking prevents re-uploads
- ‚úÖ **Startup Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of inconsistent meeting states
- ‚úÖ **VPS Sync Endpoints**: Backend APIs for duplicate checking (`/check/{id}`, `/synced`)
- Local meeting storage and management
- Workspace vs Personal meeting differentiation
- Basic UI for meeting cards and dashboard

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES** (Priority Order)
1. **üö® VPS Performance**: VPS becomes unresponsive/freezes during meeting processing
2. **Data Redundancy**: Local and VPS meetings shown separately
3. **Audio Storage**: Audio files remain locally after sync
4. **Memory Usage**: Dashboard loading could be optimized further

### üéØ **ROOT CAUSE - VPS Freezing:**
- **Memory Overload**: Whisper model + large audio files exceed RAM
- **Blocking Operations**: Synchronous transcription locks the server
- **No Concurrency Control**: Multiple uploads overwhelm resources
- **Resource Starvation**: CPU/Memory maxed during processing
